# Clustering Products

## Project description
This project clusters the products of an e-commerce website using k-means clustering of scikit-learn.

## Clustering Principles:
Clustering of products has been done by two attributes of the product. I.e., with respect to the Title of the product & Tags associated with the product.
Optimal value of K will be obtained by the Elbow method. I.e., the first converging point of the CSS curve.
